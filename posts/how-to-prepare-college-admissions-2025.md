# How to Prepare for College Admissions in India 2025

Preparing early is the key to converting effort into the best possible seat. This guide covers calendars, documents, shortlisting and counselling strategy.

## Create an exam calendar
List the entrance tests relevant to your course — JEE, NEET, KCET, COMEDK, state CETs — and mark registration & exam dates.

## Prioritise mock tests
Use weekly mocks to measure progress. Analyse weak topics and create a revision plan focused on those chapters.

## Documents & digital copies
Scan 10th/12th marksheets, transfer certificate, identity proof, caste/domicile certificates. Keep them in a single compressed PDF for uploads.

## Shortlist with ROI
Shortlist colleges under three buckets — dream, target, safe — based on fees, placements and distance. Use last year's closing ranks as a guide.

## Track applications
Maintain a spreadsheet with application links, fees paid, and submission dates. Set calendar reminders for counselling rounds.

## Use counselling wisely
Attend mock allotments and keep alternatives ready. If unsure, opt for expert short counselling.
