# How to Prepare for College Admissions in India 2025

Preparing for college admissions is a multi-step process that starts well before application windows open. Follow this practical guide to stay ahead.

## 1. Know the exam calendar
Make a list of the entrance exams relevant to your course (JEE, NEET, KCET, state CETs, CAT). Note registration dates, exam dates, and counselling windows.

## 2. Prioritise study and mock tests
Create a weekly plan that balances syllabus coverage and mock tests. Mock tests reveal weak topics — fix them early.

## 3. Organise documents
Scan and save copies of 10th & 12th marksheets, transfer certificates, caste/domicile certificates, and identity proofs. Keep both scanned PDFs and printed copies.

## 4. Shortlist colleges realistically
Match your expected rank with previous year cutoffs. Create a list with 'dream', 'target', and 'safe' colleges based on fees, placements, and ROI.

## 5. Apply early and track deadlines
Many private colleges open early applications. Use a spreadsheet to track application fees, submission dates, and document uploads.

## 6. Seek counselling when needed
If you feel overwhelmed, book a short counselling session — many portals offer one-on-one advice that helps convert rank into the best available seat.
